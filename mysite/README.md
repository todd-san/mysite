---
## Applications

----
## Features (coming soon)
  - **blog**
    - written as an SPA
    - markdown enabled editing/preview.
      - Angular vs. Django Markdown ???
    - need a **"login"** so that I alone, can edit shit.
    - need a **"search"** feature/widget that prioritizes by:
        1. tags
        2. titles
        3. preview
        4. content
  - **slack bot hosting**
    - need to look back at my old app to see how I ran it.
    - need to create a attribute-based search engine.
      - ex. *" I want a card with reach, cmc: 3, p/t: 3/2"*
  - **Documentation Repo**
    - precursor to a *blog-post*
    - more for documentation on *EVERYTHING* not just blog posting
    - only seen on sign-in.
  - **Z-Fitness**
    - my imagined idea of what Z would need for a basic site/portal for people he gives workout advice for.
      - Provide a proper channel for:
        - planning workouts
        - feedback from individuals
        - workout videos (linked or original)
        - scheduling
        - encouragement
        - some metric tracking.
    - Additionally an iPhone/Android App to pair with the site and upload metrics.. leveraging the awesome apps on the iPhone.
      - phone app would have your:
        - current workout schedule
        - current metrics & metric history
        - links to videos
        - links to Spotify music?
